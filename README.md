## AI – Intelligent HR Automation

## Overview
This project explores Agentic AI concepts by building an intelligent automation system that orchestrates HR-related tasks using Python-based long-chain workflows.

The objective is to demonstrate how AI agents can support decision-making, automation routing, and task execution in enterprise automation scenarios.

## Problem Statement
Traditional automation systems follow static rules and workflows. This project explores how agent-based AI systems can dynamically analyze inputs and decide which automation actions to perform.

## Solution Approach
- AI-driven workflow orchestration
- Modular task execution
- Decision logic handled by intelligent agents
- Python-based implementation

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Agentic AI concepts
- Workflow orchestration logic
- REST-based task triggers (conceptual)

## Workflow Overview
1. Input received (HR request or event)
2. Agent analyzes intent and context
3. Appropriate automation workflow selected
4. Tasks executed sequentially or conditionally
5. Output generated and logged

## Use Cases
- Intelligent HR request routing
- Automation decision support
- Task prioritization
- Context-aware automation execution
